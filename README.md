Yes. That's me. 

I am a Software Engineer by profession.&nbsp;:technologist:

I build things. Started off with web development in 2015 as a hobby, did some freelancing, then moved on to building full stack web and mobile applications professionally in 2018 and now I'm working on [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) with some amazing folks at [Progress](https://www.progress.com/).

Apart from tech stuff, I indulge myself in sketching and making doodles, cooking, clicking pictures, reading books and listening to music and podcasts.

You can find me on a bunch of places on the internet:

Yes. That's me. 

I am a full-stack developer — Software Development Engineer by profession. 🐱‍💻

I make mobile 📱 apps and websites 🖥️ - and have been doing so for almost 3 years now. 💻

Currently, I'm focusing on system design principles and architectural patterns - and preparing for AWS certification. ⚒️

And also UI/UX! ✨ By learning design theory. You can connect with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/rishiikc) and become a part of my journey!

I'm also interested in gaming, art, travel, food, and music! So @ me whenever you find something good! 💥 

Don't praise windows in front of me. 😏 I'm a nix person. 😌 (Use MacOS every day, but still prefer Linux - XFCE or Gnome)

I'm a boring person who will not skip over any step while on his learning journey and follow a [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh). I'm currently on this [part](https://roadmap.sh/backend) (Scroll down 🖱️ to Design and development principles - yes that's where I am now!). 

I have learned a lot from the dev community out here on the internet and would love to help anyone who needs it! So don't think and ping me and I'll reply ASAP! ☺️

I have just started being active on the internet too! You can find me on :

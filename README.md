I'm a Software Engineer working at [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) (part of [Progress](https://www.progress.com/)). I build things.

My journey in tech kicked off as a hobby in 2015. What started as a love for tinkering soon evolved into freelance work, and by 2018, it transformed into a thriving career building web and mobile applications after I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Although my nine-to-five no longer revolves around creating web and mobile applications, you can find me building stuff in my free time.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:

- Taking photographs 📸
- Sketching and making doodles ✏️
- Cooking delicious meals 🍳
- Reading books 📚
- Listening to music and podcasts 🎧

There used to be a list here (and on stackshare [![StackShare](http://img.shields.io/badge/tech-stack-0690fa.svg?style=flat)](https://stackshare.io/rishichawda/my-stack)) but I never got around to updating either.

So, just like Linkin Park once sang - "..it doesn't even matter!" <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExOHE2cHFkNnA3NDg1dHJib2x1dWdpdDVzZ2ZwMzJ4bXh4MmpyOGZmaiZlcD12MV9zdGlja2Vyc19zZWFyY2gmY3Q9cw/6m7jegpkxj4c2zNx8f/giphy.gif" alt="Stats" width="25">
